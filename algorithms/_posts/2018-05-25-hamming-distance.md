title: Hamming Distance
tags: 
    - Python
description: 
    - "The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different."
    - "Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance."
example:
    - input: x = 1, y = 4
      output: 2
note:
    - "0 â‰¤ `x`, `y` < 2<sup>31</sup>"
