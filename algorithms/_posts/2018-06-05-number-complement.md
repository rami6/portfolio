title: Number Complement
tags: 
    - Python
description: 
    - "Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation."
example: 
    - input: 5
      output: 2
      explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
    - input: 1
      output: 0
      explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

note: 
    - The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
    - You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
