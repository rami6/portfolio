  <h4 class="subtitle">♦︎ About Me ♦︎</h4>
  <p>
    I am a back-end developer who loves creating things and is enthusiastic about solving problems. Although I had solved problems as a strategy consultant for 3+ years, now I would like to do it by creating applications, websites or anything we can see.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides programming, I love making sweets! If I am in your team, sometimes you can get delicious sweets made by me :)

  <h4 class="subtitle">♦︎ Works ♦︎</h4>
  <p>
    Now I am working on an application using Django. It is for sweets makers.
  </p>
  <p>Help users to:</p>
  <p>
    - Plan making sweets
    - Create shopping list for missing ingredients
    - Refer pieces of information 
  </p>
  <p>
    Each user records what they made and what they want to make with picture and recipe url. Also, they can register contents in their storage with expiration date.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once I finish the work, I will write about it here.
