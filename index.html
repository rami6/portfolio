  <h4 class="subtitle">♦︎ About Me ♦︎</h4>
  <p>
    I am a back-end engineer who loves creating things and is enthusiastic about solving problems. Although I had solved problems  as a strategy consultant for 3+ years, now I would like to do it by creating applications, websites or anything we can see.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides programming, I love baking! If I am in your team, sometimes you can get delicious sweets made by me :)

  <p>
    Now I am working on a point management application using Django. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The Application is for a cafe where I am working for. Our cafe publishes stamp cards for customers and keep them at till. When customers come, we have to looking for their cards. Cards are sorted alphabetically, but it still takes time to find the exact one.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm going to solve the problem by new application! Once I finish the work, I will write about it here.
